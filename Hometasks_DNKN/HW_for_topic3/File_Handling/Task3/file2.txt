Sing, Blue Silver
And watching lovers part
I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes
With a thought to stiffen brooding lies
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
Sing, Blue Silver
Sing, Sing Blue Silver
