# Topic 10: Building a Test Automation Suite, utilizing both web and API testing

This project is your chance to bring together everything you’ve learned during the training. You’ll gain hands-on experience by building a Test Automation Suite that includes both Web UI and API testing. The goal is to help you apply your skills in a real-world scenario and showcase your knowledge as a Test Automation Engineer.


## Project Requirements

The project should implement a Test Automation Framework Architecture where you can develop a suite of tests with the following components:


### 1. Web UI Test Suite

Create a suite of tests for a web user interface. At least two functionalities should be included. Feel free to use any testing framework you prefer.


### 2. API Test Suite

Develop a suite of tests for an API. This should include tests for at least these API methods: GET, POST, and PUT. You can also include tests for Data validation, and error handling. Use pytest and requests library for API testing.


### 3. Documentation

Provide basic documentation for your project:
- Using docstring within your code
- Creating a README.md file containing relevant information and instructions for running the project locally


### 4. Code Quality

All code files should produce no warning or errors while checking by `pylint`/`flake8`/`black`/`pycodestyle`.


> [!TIP]
> Optionally, use GitHub Actions to check your code quality and execute all your tests. Bonus point for an HTML report showing the results.


## Reporting

Each suite should generate its own report, detailing the results of the tests. Additionally, there should be a global report that consolidates the results from both the Web UI and API tests. Implement a logger to log the results during the test execution.


## Deadline

The deadline for submitting the project is `13/01/2024`. This gives you ample time to plan, develop, test, and refine your Test Automation Suite. Remember, the goal is not just to complete the project, but to learn and grow as a Test Automation Engineer.


## Submission Instructions

Create your own repository on GitHub and upload all files there. Once you're done, submit the link to your repository to our Group in Teams.


## Evaluation Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate the quality and completeness of your project. Code should allow downloading and running Web/API tests locally by following instructions that are provided in your README files.
